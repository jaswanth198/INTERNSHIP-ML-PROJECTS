Every fourth respondent in this group declares the publication of scientific documents, which is a value slightly lower than the overall average. In general, the cluster in terms of educational aspects is quite centered, but a bit closer to the green cluster, where the advantage is made by students and people without high education degrees and publications.\n<br><br>\n<p style=\"color:#86B5D4; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Over 5 years coding ratio: 28% (-3%)</b></p>\n<p style=\"color:#86B5D4; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Over 5 years in ML methods ratio: 6% (-3%)</b></p>\n<br>\nIn the blue countries, on average, 28% of respondents declare at least 5 years of experience in coding (which is 3 percentage points less than the average for all countries). We have the same absolute differences in the percentage of people with more than 5 years of experience in using machine learning methods, which is declared by an average of 6% of respondents from each country in this group (9% in the population).

The TRU ratio in this sector is 9% (when it is 10% in all countries). On average, less than every fifth respondent declares using at least one cloud platform - the same as in all groups, looking at the whole. The funds spent on cloud computing and machine learning are also at the same level as the overall average (27% vs. 28% in the percentage of people who spent at least USD 1 on these technologies).\n<br><br>\n<p style=\"color:#86B5D4; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Python ratio: 75% (-4%)</b></p>\n<p style=\"color:#86B5D4; margin-bottom:0\"><b>R ratio: 22% (2%)</b></p>\n<br>\nIn programming languages, on average in the countries belonging to the second cluster, 75% of people declare using Python, which is a value 4 percentage points lower than that of the general public. It is also the lowest value of all 3 groups. On the other hand, the R language has above-average popularity, the use of which is declared by an average of 22% of respondents in these countries.

The value of 18% applies to the percentage of respondents employed in companies with at least 1,000 employees, both in the countries of the analyzed group and in the entire population. Also, on average, 18% of people declare that working in companies employs at least 5 data scientists, but this time it is below the global average (which is 20%). Earnings are also somewhat below the global level - in the \"blue\" countries, on average, 21% of respondents earn more than 10,000 USD per year, while the average value for the country in the entire population is 25%.\n<br><br>\nTaking into account all factors, we can see that in many of them the difference between the mean value of the factors in the cluster and in the population is very small. Differences, if present, are always expressed as a single-digit percentage. <span style=\"color:#86B5D4\"><b>Due to the similarity of the overall average, we call this cluster \"Worldwide balance\", which on the one hand characterizes the geographical spread of this group, and on the other hand, informs about the moderation in the values of almost all factors</b></span>. The respondents from countries in this sector are mostly moderately aged men with high education, but there are also students.

Both of these values are greater than in the population, but it is worth noting that, in contrast to the previous groups of countries, the difference here is not large (5 and 4 percentage points, respectively).\n<br><br>\n<p style=\"color:#D75151; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Over 1000 employees in comapny ratio: 26% (+8%)</b></p>\n<p style=\"color:#D75151; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Over 5 data scientist in comapny ratio: 30% (+11%)</b></p>\n<p style=\"color:#D75151; margin-bottom:0\"><b>Over 10,000 USD salary ratio: 45% (+20%)</b></p>\n<br>\nin the population, as 26% of respondents from the analyzed countries declare work in a company with at least 1,000 employees (18% of the population). The number of data scientists in the company is even better than the average in comparison with company size - 30% of respondents declare that their company employs over 4 data scientists, which significantly exceeds the value for the population of 19%. We can also see a significant difference in earnings, where 45% of respondents declare an income of at least USD 10,000 within 12 months - this is a value of 20 percentage points higher than in the population, where every fourth respondent declares such income in last year.\n<br><br>\nThis group stands out from the other two, especially comparing it with the green cluster. <span style=\"color:#D75151\"><b>We call this group \"Old Guard\" because of the high advantage of experienced people, often older with higher education, who have solved many data problems in their careers. They are now leaders, but their future as countries is at stake as more and more people in the other two clusters are taking their first steps in the world of data</b></span>. People who are part of this cluster are characterized not only by an average more advanced age and level of education, much longer experience in coding and using machine learning, more than average knowledge of cloud technologies and related expenses, experience in both Python and R higher than in other countries and frequent work in large companies with a large number of people with a similar profile and higher earnings. These are values in relation to the population average, which means that in this country we also find students, people entering the career and without much experience, but it is easier to find such people in other clusters.\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-5\"></a>\n<div class=\"alert alert-light\" role=\"alert\">\n<b><h3>5. Summary and conclusions</b></h3>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The analysis has now been completed, so it's time to sum up. <b>Our goal was to create the determinants of respondents by country, analyze them in one and two dimensions and create groups of countries most similar to each other in relation to these factors using hierarchical grouping</b>. The goal was fully achieved and many interesting conclusions were drawn while achieving it. The key points from the analysis carried out are:</div>\n\n1. In total, we managed to create 15 factors for responders from 39 analyzed countries based on over 21,000 completed questionnaires.\n2. 40% of the surveyed questionnaires were from one country (India) and 60% from 3 countries (India + USA + Japan).\n3. The top countries with the highest masculinization rate of the respondents are mainly countries in South America.\n4. The young respondents are mostly in Asia and Africa, and the older are in Europe.\n5. Two educational groups of countries can be distinguished: students, without a large share of highly educated people and scientific publications (mainly African and Asian countries), and countries with a small number of students, but with a large number of educated people (leading world economies).\n6. The coding and ML experience can be seen above all in countries with older and more educated communities.\n7. Japan and the Netherlands lead the way in cloud and TPU technologies, with the highest percentage of people using such tools.\n8. Python is a very popular language all over the world, while R is most popular in South America, but everywhere we can see the dominance of the \"snake\" language.\n9. Work in large companies, with high salaries and many data scientists is the domain of western countries, led by the Netherlands, Germany and UK.\n10. The most atypical countries from the rest are the Netherlands, Nigeria and Tunisia.\n11. The strongest correlations can be found between factors of the same category (education, technology and jobs).\n12. The countries where young men are the most dominant are Bangladesh, Pakistan and Viet Nam.\n13. Japan is unique in terms of experience: people often have a long experience in coding but very little in using ML methods compared to other countries.\n14. The largest companies with the highest salaries at the same time are the domain of West Europe, Japan and the USA.\n15. Data science 2030 is a group of people from Asian and African countries full of students and people who enter the broadly understood world of data.\n16. Worldwide balance is a group of people who belong to countries where most statistics are close to the global average (halfway between the \"Data Science 2030\" cluster and the \"Old guard\" group).\n17. Old guard is a set of highly developed countries in which there are many people with extensive education and professional and technical experience.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The summary is ready, so looking more broadly and adding a broader context, the analysis allows us to try what it means for the entire environment and what impact the data science image has today at the country level for the near future of the entire industry. The most important suggestions at that point are:</div><br>\n\n<b>A. If you are a respondent from green sector countries... you have a lot of people competing around each other but also a lot of potential!</b><br>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Green cluster countries are the most densely populated places with a large number of young people (this is also visible in the number of respondents and in publicly available demographic data). For young data enthusiasts who enter the career path, there is a great advantages and a disadvantage at the same time. On the one hand, a large number of students means that there are a whole lot of people of a similar age with whom you can cooperate and motivate yourself, and the fact that there is such an advantage for young people is certainly optimistic when looking at the future when it comes to the speed of market development and its potential. On the other hand, such many people have a lot of competition, which means that it may be more difficult for people with no experience to start a dream job. Nevertheless, head up - the future of the data world is already being born in India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Indonesia!</div><br>\n\n<b>B. If you are an experienced ML engineer and you are not in western countries then... maybe it is worth increasing your contacts or pursuing your career in the red group countries!</b><br>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The countries of the red cluster, although often the majority of them are still students, have much larger percentage of people from whom you can learn a lot (extensive work experience, high academic degrees). If you have indicated that you have or are in the course of a doctorate, you have at least several years of experience working with ML methods, a trip to the red group countries (if you do not live in them yet) may be helpful because you will be cooperate in a group of people who are equally or even more experienced, which will surely push your skills and development forward!</div><br>\n\n<b>C. If you don't use Python and cloud tools then... maybe it's worth changing it!</b><br>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Python today is almost everywhere in data and is the core technology for today's data scientists, no matter where you live. So it's worth having it in your technology stack, and if you already have it, develop it further. A tool that is not that popular, but very useful are various types of cloud computing services. It is worth noting that there is a very strong positive correlation between earnings and the use of the cloud, so learning to use at least one cloud technology give a big chance to translate it into your earnings in the future!</div><br>\n\n<b>D. If your company is looking for new data enthusiasts then... maybe it is worth opening an office in Asia!</b><br>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Large companies are often based in many developed countries and face a shortage of workers there. If your company has adequate funds and it lacks data scientists (especially those with less experience), there will certainly be plenty of people in Asian and African countries who could potentially work with you. Of course, the reality is more complicated and opening a branch in India and Nigeria is not a trivial and quick thing, but it is worth keeping in mind the fact that currently there are a lot of young, talented and ready-to-learn people who want to work with data!</div><br>\n\n<b>E. No matter where you are from... it is important that you are developing!</b>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">And the most important thing in the end - we only talked about dependencies at the country level and general trends that do not describe specific person. Remember that the place where you were born or where you currently live is usually important, but not everything. If you are from a country where the percentage of very experienced people and with many levels of education is low, it does not mean that you will also have the same one. The most important thing is progress, continuous learning and not falling into stereotypes. You decide to the greatest extent what data enthusiasts you are and what you will be in the future. Head up and good luck!</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-6\"></a>\n<div class=\"alert alert-light\" role=\"alert\">\n<h3><b>6.
